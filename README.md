# Authsignal + IdentityServer Example

[Go here for the official integration guide on our docs site](https://docs.authsignal.com/integrations/identityserver)

## Overview

[Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) is an ASP.NET Core framework for building your own login server in compliance with OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 standards.

This example shows how to integrate IdentityServer with Authsignal in 2 steps:

1. Adding MFA to a traditional username & password login flow
2. Allowing passkey login as an secure and user-friendly alternative to username & password

Authsignal can be used to facilitate both MFA on login (step 1) and passwordless login (step 2).
